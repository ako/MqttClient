# Mendix MQTT connector

Mendix module to send and receive [MQTT][1] messages. This module uses the [Eclipse Paho][3] library. 
Tested with [AWS IoT][5], [The Things network][4] and [mosquitto][2] brokers.

## Usage

Main java actions:

 * MqttPublish - publish a message to specified topic
 * MqttSubscribe - subscribe to a topic. Required you to specify a microflow which will be called upon receiving
   a message. This microflow should have two string parameters: Topic and Payload.
 * MqttUnsubscribe - unsubscribe from topic

## Usage with Amazon AWS IoT
 
You need to register your app as a Thing on AWS IoT. Download the generated certificates and store them in your resources 
folder of your app. When subscribing or publishing a message specify their location reletive to the resources folder.

## Usage with TTN

For TTN you can leave the certificate info empty, instead provide username and password.

Microflow to subscribe to an MQTT topic:

 ![MQTT subscribe to topic][10]

Configuration of subscribe for TTN:

Microflow to handled messages received:

More info can be found here: [Using Mendix with TTN][14]

## Usage with IBM IoT
To use IBM IOT you need to fill in your organisation ID with your organisation ID. For the Username & Password you need to use the API Key for the username and Authentication Token for password.

### Setting up your IBM Application
To get your API Key and Authentication token login to your IBM IOT Launchpad and click on apps. Then click new Generate New API Key.

## Development

Java dependencies are managed using Apache Ivy. There are two configuration:
* export - this is used to make sure only the required jars for the connector module are in userlib
* default - this downloads all dependencies required to run the project

Before you export the connector module run runivy-export.cmd to ensure you have the correct set of libraries to be
included in the connector mpk.
